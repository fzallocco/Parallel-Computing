# 1. Paralle Computing - CS6910 Class Assignments

In the 2023 fall semester (September - December), I studied the principles of Parallel Computing using the C programming language and the C* simulator built by Dr. Bruce P Lester.

The course taught me to leverage the multi-core capability of modern CPUs, simulating a multi-computer environment similar to that of a GPU. Executing the C scripts in each of the folders do not require a dedicated GPU, but it is recommended to download the C* simulator from a reliable source and read its manual.
